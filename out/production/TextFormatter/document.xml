<line=This layer would be randomly initialized and trained with the rest of the model, so the embedding vector for each category learns through training./>
<line=To incorporate semantic_category and duration_bin as input embeddings alongside the CodeBERT output for method_token, consider concatenating all these embeddings:/>
<line=However, CodeBERT is primarily trained on code tokens and natural language text, which means it may not inherently capture any relationships between arbitrary labels like semantic_category./>
